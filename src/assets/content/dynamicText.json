    "Birds are everywhere in our cities. We eat chicken, pet parrots, and see sparrows flying around. Among all the living beings, birds are a unique group of animals that's so close to people living in cities while having three distinct roles: food, pets, and neighbors.",
    "By experiencing this process of connecting the birds' names and their roles, followed by two bird's journey of objectification, and the comparison between food, pet and neighbor, I hope we could all review and rethink our relationships with chicken, parrots and sparrows in our life.",
    "Though humans' needs for birds as products might never be gone, I hope one day all birds could just be flapping their wings as they're born to do."
